                I am passionate about building and automating 
                systems that make the everyday life of man easier. 
                My goal is to be able to build software that automates 
                processes for indurtries and organizations as well as 
                building aesthetically alluring web applications that 
                makes everyday life fullfilling. I am also enthusiastic 
                about educating young growing minds within my circle with 
                the aim of reducing the wide digital divide that exists in 
                my community.
